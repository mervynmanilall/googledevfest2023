# googledevfest2023
This repo contains all the codes (microservices) and slides that I have used during my session for the google dev fest 2023 Mauritius. 
You can view a recording of the session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZNqZqXXsNk

The project googledevfestdemo contains the first microservice, which in the presentation, is the 'Contruction API'
The project googledevfestdemo2 contains the second microservice, which in the presentation, is the 'User API'
There is the frontend code in the frontend folder. In the frontend, you can stop any of the microservice. You will see that the app is still running but only one feature is not available.
The presentation can be found in the 'presentation' folder.
